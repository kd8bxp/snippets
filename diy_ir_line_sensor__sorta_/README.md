# DIY IR Line Sensor (sorta)

## Usage

Acutally I am not sure what to do with this, it is sort of how the line sensors work, but I setup the the emitter to pulse on and off. (Why? well I thought maybe I could count the return pulses and see how far away something was - That didn't quite work, because the object needs to be pretty close) It might be useful for something thou sometime in the future.

IR emitter is connected to pin 3, IR receiver is connected to pin 2.
(In the pictures you also can see a 433Mhz transmitter - it's not used or needed for this sketch - and is part of yet another project)
